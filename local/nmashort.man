       Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network exploration
       and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks,
       although it works fine against single hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in
       novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what
       services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what
       operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
       filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. While
       Nmap is commonly used for security audits, many systems and network
       administrators find it useful for routine tasks such as network
       inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
       service uptime.

       The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with supplemental
       information on each depending on the options used. Key among that
       information is the “interesting ports table”.  That table lists the port
       number and protocol, service name, and state. The state is either open,
       filtered, closed, or unfiltered.  Open means that an application on the
       target machine is listening for connections/packets on that port.
       Filtered means that a firewall, filter, or other network obstacle is
       blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is open or closed.
       Closed ports have no application listening on them, though they could
       open up at any time. Ports are classified as unfiltered when they are
       responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
       open or closed. Nmap reports the state combinations open|filtered and
       closed|filtered when it cannot determine which of the two states describe
       a port. The port table may also include software version details when
       version detection has been requested. When an IP protocol scan is
       requested (--ssOO), Nmap provides information on supported IP protocols
       rather than listening ports.

       In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide further
       information on targets, including reverse DNS names, operating system
       guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

       A typical Nmap scan is shown in Example 1. The only Nmap arguments used
       in this example are --AA, to enable OS and version detection, script
       scanning, and traceroute; --TT44 for faster execution; and then the
       hostname.
